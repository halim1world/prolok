A greater reluctance to pay out of pocket for health care expenses has seen a greater awareness of the benefits of health insurance. As with many other facilities, there are both private and public options.\r\n\r\n<strong> Medicare – The Public Option </strong>\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1984, Medicare ensures that all Australians have access to free treatment at public hospitals. Medicare benefits also include treatment from specialists, general practitioners, dentists and optometrists who participate in the scheme for free or subsidised fees.\r\n\r\nParticipating dentists and optometrists can render particular services only, as described by the Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS), while the cost of other general, or ancillary treatments has to be borne by the patient. Prescription medication is also greatly subsidised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that comes under the Medicare umbrella. In short, Medicare means:\r\n\r\n- free admission to a public hospital and care, treatment and after-care from nominated health care providers\r\n\r\n- the possibility of being liable (paying out of pocket) for hospital accommodation, fees for operation theater use and medication.\r\n\r\nMedicare provides such services based on tax contributions from all Australians, as well as an extra levy imposed on those earning a high income. For single people, this threshold is $73,000 for the year 2009-10, while couples with a combined income of $143,000 and above are subject to the Medicare- levy. Low-income earners are not required to contribute to Medicare.\r\n\r\n<strong> Eligibility For Medicare </strong>\r\n\r\nAustralian residents are eligible for this public health insurance scheme as long as they are Australian or New Zealand citizens, hold permanent (Australian) visas or have applied for one, although terms and conditions may apply.\r\n\r\nIndividuals whose citizenship status is less clear cut may also have to submit documents supporting their Australian residency.\r\n\r\n<strong>Private health insurance </strong>\r\n\r\nAnother option for Australians is private health insurance, obtained courtesy of private health insurance providers, or funds. The largest and most well known of these is Medibank Private, a government- owned fund that follows the same regulations as other private health funds.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the norms in America, Australian health insurance premiums aren\'t determined by age, health, address or even medical history. Private health funds in Australia fall in to the following categories:\r\n\r\n- for-profit: such as MBF Health Fund, or the Health Insurance Fund of Australia\r\n\r\n- non-profit: such as HCF Health Insurance or GMHBA\r\n\r\n- regional: such as HBF, which provides for residents of Western Australia, or the Territory Insurance  Office, which caters to the Northern Territory\r\n\r\nA person can determine which private health fund to opt for by comparing policies online. Those who subscribe to private funds have a wider range of health care options compared to those on Medicare. Based on the premiums paid, an individual can opt to have the fund take care of out of pocket expenses that aren\'t already covered by Medicare.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Importance of Being Community-Rated </strong>\r\n\r\nAll private funds may not refuse a person a policy or subscription based on the following factors:\r\n\r\n- race\r\n\r\n- religion\r\n\r\n- gender\r\n\r\n- job\r\n\r\n- sexual orientation\r\n\r\n- hobbies\r\n\r\nA community-rated fund ensures that all potential subscribers may purchase policies at the same rates or premiums and enjoy the same benefits as others who subscribe to the same plan. Inter-state premiums may exist for a particular product, but intra-state differences are forbidden.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Waiting Game </strong>\r\n\r\nWhile private funds may extend more comprehensive health coverage to subscribers, private health insurers may also impose a waiting period of up to one year at their discretion, especially where preexisting ailments (PEA) are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe period is imposed in order to minimise the risk that a fund may attract profit-seeking subscribers, whose presence may impact on other subscribers in the form of higher premiums and/or fewer benefits. It can also apply to new memberships or existing subscribers who want to upgrade their cover.\r\n\r\nA waiting period prolongs the duration an individual has to wait to receive benefits for a claim. For individuals with PEA or an obstetric condition, it means that the fund will not pay out claims for the first 12 months of the policy. Medical practitioners define PEA as an illness or ailment that existed 6 months before subscription or upgrading.\r\n\r\n<strong> The Push for Private Insurance Policies </strong>\r\n\r\nThe following schemes are designed to encourage Australians to purchase private health insurance instead of relying solely on Medicare or paying out of pocket, and much earlier:\r\n\r\nLifetime health cover – an individual is liable for an annual “loading” fee of 2% if he or she takes out private hospital, not ancillary, coverage on the first July after they are 30 years of age. This means that a span of 5 years will see an individual paying a total of 10% more for health insurance premiums, but only for the first ten years following the initial subscription.\r\n\r\nPrivate health insurance rebate – subscribers to private health insurance policies, both ancillary and hospital, stand to enjoy government subsidies on premiums paid on a sliding scale.\r\n\r\nMedicare levy surcharge – single individuals whose taxable income exceeds $73,000 or couples whose combined income exceeds $140,000 who don\'t have private health insurance face a surcharge of 1% in addition to the 1.5% Medicare tax when it comes to health care fees. In this aspect, a private hospital policy is a more affordable and beneficial alternative.\r\n\r\nGoing to the doctor is never an enjoyable experience, and it\'s fortunate a person has to option of turning to health insurance to meet the expense. In addition to being proportionate to the income earned, a person\'s health insurance policy should cover his or her needs comprehensively.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:42:\"Health Insurance in Australia: An Overview\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:41:\"health-insurance-in-australia-an-overview\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 09:24:50\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 09:24:50\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:44:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=3\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:1;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:8;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-10-16 08:35:18\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-16 08:35:18\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:5666:\"Purchasing a private health insurance policy is not a decision that can be made lightly. A policy at odds with your needs may mean having to pay slightly more out of pocket for treatment at the very least. At worst, it may mean discovering that the policy whose premiums you\'ve faithfully paid all these years actually doesn\'t cover the procedure for which you\'re being hospitalised.\n\nComparing policies from different private health funds isn\'t as simple as determining whose premiums are lower, although that certainly helps. There are also other aspects a consumer should keep in mind when comparing policies, whether with an online tool or plain, old-fashioned enquiries to ensure apples aren\'t being compared to oranges.\n<h2>Pay For Only What You Need</h2>\nMany consumers believe that they have no choice but to accept whatever policy a health fund offers, when the opposite is actually true. Tailor-making a policy is a surefire way of ensuring that a person in his or her twenties doesn\'t have to pay for a knee replacement, whereas a senior citizen would certainly look at insurance for cardio-thoracic procedures instead of that for obstetrics.\n\nPaying only for an essential coverage policy means that a person has to evaluate his or her policy from time to time. This should be done to ensure coverage of the needs most relevant to the person and their family at that particular time and reap the most benefits from premiums paid.\n<h2>Types of Health Insurance to Consider</h2>\nComparing health insurance policies means knowing exactly what you get with the following covers:\n\n<strong>Hospital</strong> – a person can claim reimbursement from a fund for the cost of accommodation, treatment and ambulance transport to a private hospital.\n\n<strong>Extras</strong> – these include medical services not rendered in a hospital environment and which Medicare doesn\'t cover, including optical, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy and alternative treatment as well as ambulance transport.\n\n<strong>Hospital-extras</strong> – this combines the best of hospital and extras cover for optimum general coverage, and are usually offered together with another policy.\n<h2>See What Profile You Fit</h2>\nMost consumers fall in to the following categories, from which a health policy that meets their needs most accurately can be rendered:\n\n<strong>Young and single</strong> – young to middle-aged couples who already have children and have no plans to expand the family. Cover for people in this profile tends toward hospital cover for general procedures that include optical, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy treatment.\n\n<strong>Young couples/family with/without obstetrics</strong> – people fitting this profile are young to middle-aged couples planning to have children. The profile also includes couples who intend to add to their existing family. People like this are more interested in in vitro fertilisation (IVF)/obstetrics and hospital and extras cover than that for knee replacement or open heart surgery.\n\n<strong>Young family, with obstetrics</strong> – includes young/middle-aged couples with young children don\'t intend to extend the family. These growing families are more interested in a wide range of cover for hospital and extra fees to cater to post-natal care and young children.\n\n<strong>Older families</strong> – encompasses established families that tend to comprise older couples and dependent offspring, i.e. those aged below 18. Families like these are less interested in obstetrics and IVF and are more concerned with braces for the children and cardio-thoracic cover for the parents. Cover for these families also tends to include that for optical, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy treatment. Young to middle-aged single parents also tend to focus on policies that cover these concerns.\n\n<strong>Mature singles/couples</strong> – individuals or couples who have never had, or no longer have dependent children worry more about their ability to meet the cost of knee/hip replacements or multi-focal lenses, as well as extras cover that encompasses optical, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy treatment. There is little or no concern for obstetrics, IVF or post-natal cover in this profile.\n<h2>Mind the Gap</h2>\nA gap is the out of pocket expense a consumer must pay when the amount paid out by a private health fund is less than the cost of a specific medical procedure or service. The gap doesn\'t exist for up to 80% of such services/procedures, but a consumer shouldn\'t take it for granted when comparing health insurance policies from different funds.\n\nDetermining if a gap exists, as well as the difference, before purchasing a policy can do a lot to put a person\'s mind at ease when he or she has to undergo hospitalisation or hospital treatment.\n<h2>How Wide is Coverage?</h2>\nPreviously, private health funds covered the treatment costs only when a person was admitted to hospital, even though the same treatment could have been rendered in a non-hospital environment. Now though, there are funds whose hospital cover extends to medical treatment received at home, such as dialysis or diabetes management. This flexibility opens up a wider range of treatment options to a patient.\n\nThese are not the only aspects to consider when comparing policies from different funds. Other factors such as employment type (e.g. medical, education, rail and transport) may also make a person eligible for a more beneficial health insurance policy. Although there is no such thing as a universal health insurance policy, a person can obtain a more thorough comparison by providing relevant, comprehensive information.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:46:\"An Introduction to Health Insurance Comparison\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:46:\"an-introduction-to-health-insurance-comparison\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2010-10-16 08:35:18\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-16 08:35:18\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:44:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=8\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:2;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:11;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-10-17 04:37:19\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-17 04:37:19\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:4479:\"Health care premiums are monthly payments rendered to insurers for the purchase of health insurance – a form of insurance which covers illness, injury and other medical expenses. Premiums function as the chief source of revenue for health insurance providers. Insurance company actuaries consider a range of factors in determining these premiums.\n\nSuch factors would include the cost of payment to healthcare practitioners, advertisements, and sales and profit margins. Consumers, however, are also able to determine the cost of their insurance premiums to some degree. The ten factors that can impact health insurance premiums are discussed below.\n<h2>Varying Options From Varying Funds</h2>\nTo ensure that you are getting the best value for your money given your needs and circumstances, it is recommended that you compare all your options from different funds before committing to a health fund. An informed decision will likely save you money on your premiums.\n<h2>Get An Early Start</h2>\nDepending on your age, if you are eligible for Medicare benefits, then you could receive up to 34% in rebate from the Federal government to help you with the cost of your private health insurance premium. Further, if you opt for hospital cover before your thirtieth birthday (or the first July following it), then you will be eligible for the lowest base rate health insurance premiums.\n<h2>Deductibles Can Vary</h2>\nThis is the annual amount that you pay out of pocket before being reimbursed for any medical expenses incurred. These tend to vary from one policy to another, and the higher the deductible that is paid, the lower your premium becomes in the end.\n<h2><strong>Co-payment </strong></h2>\nWith co-payment, policyholders pay a set amount daily every time a medical service is provided. For example, a co-payment clause in a policy may require a patient to pay the first $50 for private hospital accommodation each day. Therefore, a person is able to reduce his or her premiums by agreeing to co-payment on health insurance.\n<h2>Excess</h2>\nSome funds offer hospital cover for which there is “excess”. This is the amount paid when a person is admitted in to a private hospital. It is usually paid once and covers hospital admissions for that year, although some funds may stipulate that it may apply to each admission. The sum, however, is typically larger than what a person would pay for co-payment. Both co-payment and excess are ideal if you are relatively healthy as they reduce the amount of premium you would have to pay.\n<h2>Exclusion</h2>\nBy excluding benefits for certain forms of treatment – for example, maternity treatment or knee replacements, a policyholder will pay a lower premium. However, policies with exclusions will not cover a patient being treated for the relevant condition.\n<h2>Restricted Benefits</h2>\nA policy with restricted benefits will grant a person coverage for treatment in a public hospital, but only some of the costs will be covered if a person opts to receive treatment in a private hospital.\n<h2>Benefit Limitation Period</h2>\nA limitation period entitles a person to restricted benefits for particular conditions or treatment during a stipulated time period. For example, you could take out an insurance policy that pays full benefits for several conditions but only offers restricted benefits for hip replacement surgery for the first 3 years of the policy. After 3 years, you will be entitled to full benefits. Taking a policy with a benefit limitation period will reduce premiums.\n<h2>Advance Payment</h2>\nPremium rates could rise up to 5% every year to compensate for ever increasing medical costs. The majority of health insurance providers allow you to pay your premiums in advance to take advantage of the previous year\'s rates for the following 12 months, thus saving you some money.\n<h2>Going Abroad</h2>\nIf you will be traveling or living abroad for an extended period (longer than a few weeks but less than 2 years), some health funds will permit you to suspend membership for that period so that you do not incur increased premiums while you are away. You will be able to restart membership without additional waiting periods on your return.\n\nPolicies vary between different providers, so it is always best to consult with the relevant hospitals and your health fund first before making any decisions. But by following some of the guidelines above, you are guaranteed the best value and savings on your premiums.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:36:\"10 Factors That Impact Your Premiums\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:36:\"10-factors-that-impact-your-premiums\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2010-10-17 04:37:19\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-17 04:37:19\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=11\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:3;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:52;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-10-24 11:48:31\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-24 11:48:31\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:4728:\"Thanks to excellent weather and fantastic healthcare facilities, it\'s no wonder that Australia exerts as much attraction for overseas professionals as Western Europe and the United States do.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary concerns for foreigners working in Australia is obtaining health insurance. Most of the time, the company you work for will take care of it, but other times, the mantle of responsibility falls on the individual\'s shoulders, especially if he or she is an entrepreneur. Aside from comparing quotes and plans from different health insurers, or health funds, there are a few aspects an expat has to consider about his or her health insurance.\r\n<h2>Is Medicare Enough?</h2>\r\nWorkers who stay for more than a few months in Australia are eligible to apply for Medicare, the country\'s own healthcare system that coexists with the private healthcare. It is funded by up to 1.5% of taxpayers\' income, depending on the income tier the individual falls under.\r\n\r\nUnder Medicare, the majority of patients enjoy 100% cover of in-patient care and about 75% primary care charges at a public hospital. However, should a person choose to be admitted to a private hospital, Medicare will only cover the costs equivalent to that of a public facility, and the patient has to make up the shortfall. Additionally, there may be an age limit for Medicare applicants, which leads to private health funds being another avenue of assistance to which expats can turn.\r\n<h2>“Topping Up” with Private Health Insurance <strong>\r\n</strong></h2>\r\nAside from covering hospitalisation fees only up to that incurred in a public hospital (if admission is sought in a private facility), Medicare does not provide coverage for dental and optical care, as well as ambulance transport. These expenses may be mitigated with the use of a Low Income Earner Card, but most expats would be ineligible for this.\r\n\r\nA private health insurance policy would provide more comprehensive health management plans, and can be tailored to meet an individual\'s needs more closely. As a financial incentive, all taxpayers stand to gain up to 25% rebate if they have private health cover. The rebate can be a tax rebate or insurance premium discount. Individuals may also collect a refund from Medicare offices. As with Australian citizens, expats aged 65-69 and over 70 years stand to enjoy rebates of 30% and 34% respectively.\r\n<h2>Putting Yourself First</h2>\r\nA further incentive for expats to purchase private health cover is the Australian government\'s imposition of a higher Medicare Levy Surcharge for high income earners who do not already have private health insurance.\r\n\r\nThe definition of “high income” is based on a threshold amount and can be subject to revision. Rather than pay for health benefits for other people, most, if not all, income-earners would prefer to spend more money on themselves.\r\n<h2>Choosing A Health Fund</h2>\r\nWhile the rebate is an attractive incentive to purchase private health cover, an expat buying his or her own insurance should be aware that the health fund must be registered inside the federal scheme in order for it to qualify for tax rebates.\r\n\r\nThe expat should also determine the extent a health fund will cover healthcare fees. While most private funds may cover the costs that Medicare doesn\'t meet, some will pay the Medicare rate if a policyholder is admitted to a private hospital. Having to pay out-of-pocket in this manner thus defeats the purpose of buying health insurance in the first place.\r\n<h2>Dealing with Brokers</h2>\r\nInsurance brokers can be consulted if an expat desires full/comprehensive private cover outside of Medicare. Whether you\'re ineligible for Medicare or just want full cover anyway, you need to know what you can afford and what you consider necessary benefits.\r\n\r\nThis means having full comprehension of what is and isn\'t covered by the policy, in addition to aspects of the cover that you simply don\'t require, such as obstetrics if you\'re a single male with no plans on settling down. Helpful features to look out for include rapid settlement of claims, e.g. in 14 days, a multilingual helpline accessible 24/7 and whether cover for accidents and injuries are included in the policy.\r\n\r\nA broker can represent more than one health fund as well, so it\'s easier to find a policy that best suits you from one who has a wide network.\r\n\r\nAs with other rapidly-expanding economies, the Australian government is supportive of the influx of skilled workers to sustain trade. This, combined with the need for private health cover and a large number of health funds that keep premiums affordable, means purchasing private health insurance is an attractive prospect for the expatriate worker.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:58:\"Health Insurance: What An Expat in Australia Needs to Know\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:15:\"expat-insurance\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 07:48:12\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 07:48:12\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=52\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:4;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:59;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-11-01 09:33:24\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-11-01 09:33:24\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:5492:\"Purchasing a health insurance policy may seem quite a daunting experience when you consider the phrases bandied about. This alphabetically-arranged glossary aims to explain some of the more commonly used terms.\n\n<strong>Acute Care Certificate</strong> – This applies to long-term patients and is granted by the treating doctor. Health funds are relieved of the obligation to pay for treatment if the certificate is absent.\n\n<strong>Admission</strong> – A person must be admitted by a doctor to be treated as a private patient in a registered private, public or day hospital. Emergency treatment at a private hospital is not an admission.\n\n<strong>Agreement/Participating Hospital</strong> – A hospital that has a partner agreement with a health fund to ensure complete health cover for particular accommodation and operating theatre fees, ensuring out of pocket costs are kept to a minimum for members. Each health fund has a different list of participating hospitals, and admission to non-participating hospitals may mean a patient has to pay out-of-pocket costs.\n\n<strong>Alternative Therapies</strong> – Includes treatment via Alexander technique, acupuncture, aromatherapy, Bowen technique, Chinese medicine, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, massage, kinesiology, myotherapy, reflexology, naturopathy, shiatsu, remedial massage and western herbalism.\n\n<strong>Ancillary/Extras Cover</strong> – Includes dental, chiropractic, physiotherapy, optical, pharmacy and alternative therapies (described above) that Medicare doesn\'t cover.\n\n<strong>Annual Limit</strong> – The maximum benefit a person can receive for a specific treatment in a year and applies after the waiting period has been served.\n\n<strong>Benefits</strong> – Covers claims for treatment received at hospitals and is the minimum amount, as defined by the government, that health funds must cover.\n\n<strong>Benefit Limitation Periods</strong> – Allows a health fund member to enjoy lower insurance premiums by restricting the benefits a member can claim for treatment of specific conditions, e.g. being eligible for full knee replacement surgery benefits only after 3 years\' cover, despite the treatment\'s standard 12-month waiting period.\n\n<strong>Calendar and Membership Years</strong> – A membership year begins on the day a member joins the fund, whereas a calendar year spans January 1 to December 31. Some funds may use the terms interchangeably, so it\'s advisable to clarify this in the beginning.\n\n<strong>Change of Cover</strong> – Refers to up- or downgrading of a health policy. Members should check if this action will affect any waiting periods to be served prior to becoming eligible for benefit claims.\n\n<strong>Community Rating</strong> – Ensures that all individuals are entitled to purchase the same health insurance policy at the same price, with the guaranteed right to renew said policy. A health fund cannot refuse to insure any individual on health grounds.\n\n<strong>Compensation and Damages from Others</strong> – Refers to compensation and/or damages that can be claimed from compulsory third party insurance, worker\'s compensation, common law, travel insurance, sports insurance, crimes compensation and litigation.\n\n<strong>Co-Payment</strong> – The amount a member agrees to pay for the cost of hospital admission.\n\n<strong>Dependants</strong> – Defined as children and students (full-time) under 25 years living at home with no dependents of their own.\n\n<strong>Excess</strong> – The amount a member agrees to pay for each hospital admission before benefits are paid out. Members tend to opt for higher excess to maintain lower premiums.\n\n<strong>Exclusions</strong> – Hospital procedures (public or private) for which a member will not receive payment.\n\n<strong>Gap/Out-of-Pocket Expenses</strong> – The difference that exists between the fees charged by doctors and the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee.\n\n<strong>General Treatment Cover</strong> – Covers non-hospital medical services excluded by Medicare, e.g. optical, dental, physiotherapy, other therapy and ambulance.\n\n<strong>Medicare Levy Surcharge</strong> – A surcharge imposed by the government for those who don\'t have hospital cover. Obtaining even basic hospital cover is usually cheaper than paying an additional 1% on taxable income.\n\n<strong>Restricted Benefits</strong> – Refers to a policy that provides fewer/limited benefits and the minimum payout for specific treatments in “exchange” for lower premiums. Often, members have to pay for theatre fees, same day theatre or intensive and coronary care units.\n\n<strong>Waiting Period</strong> – The duration a member has to wait after joining a health fund to become eligible for benefits. Waiting periods may vary with each health fund.\n\n<strong>Rebate</strong> – Health fund members are entitled to this rebate, which can be claimed a discount on premiums paid or claimed as a rebate on an annual tax return. It is based on income and there are differing rebate levels depending on age and income.\n\nThis list is just a small section of the terms used in private health insurance today. As each health fund may possess its own terms, it\'s always best to ask for clarification before committing to a health insurance policy.\n<h4><span id=\"DisclaimerThe_above_information_is_correct_and_current_at_the_time_of_publication\">Disclaimer: The above information is correct and current at the time of publication.</span></h4>\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:46:\"Knowing the Lingo: A Health Insurance Glossary\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:47:\"knowing-the-lingo-a-health-insurance-glossary-2\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2010-11-01 09:33:24\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-11-01 09:33:24\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=59\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:5;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:64;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-11-05 09:26:40\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-11-05 09:26:40\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:4845:\"Finding out you\'re about to become a parent is one of the most thrilling, yet unnerving experiences you could ever hope to have. A person\'s life usually becomes a whirlwind of planning from the moment you get the (good) news from the doctor to the minute labour begins. Not only is there a nursery to prepare and an education fund to build, it would be remiss for any prospective parent to neglect planning for the new arrival\'s health insurance.\r\n<h2>Couples vs. Family Health Insurance</h2>\r\nIf you\'ve never given much thought to family health insurance because you already have couples insurance, it\'s definitely time for a rethink! A couples insurance policy provides cover for medical costs incurred for an individual and his or her partner, but it may not include cover for obstetrics and related services.\r\n\r\nMaking sure that the latest addition to the family is included in the health insurance policy is a good way to ensure peace of mind, especially when it comes to the myriad expenses a growing child can run up.\r\n<h2>The Medicare Safety Net May Not Cover It All</h2>\r\nThe Medicare Safety Net would seem to be a failsafe option for couples or individuals with a child on the way. However, it operates on the basis of a family reaching a threshold amount of gap or out-of-pocket payments before you receive benefits for the rest of the calendar year.\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Safety Net and Medicare cover do not provide cover for admission to a private hospital either. Most of the time, births in a private hospital are more unlikely to require intensive care or emergency resuscitation, while births in a public hospital tend to record a higher number of such incidences.\r\n\r\nNot only that, there is a lower incidence of low Apgar scores, neonatal death or injury to women who give birth in private hospitals. Most of the time, comprehensive cover for such maternity and neonatal requirements is available only from private health funds.\r\n<h2>Upgrading An Existing Policy</h2>\r\nWhether you have an existing policy or are thinking of signing up for one before starting a family, most funds advise upgrading or signing up for birth or child-related cover 12 months before the family\'s newest addition arrives.\r\n\r\nThis is because most policies impose a waiting period for obstetric cover that usually spans 12 months. This means that a couple or the individual would have to pay the premiums for the related fund for 12 months before becoming eligible to claim for insurance benefits.\r\n<h2>Getting Help With Expenses</h2>\r\nSome people might question the need to include children in a health insurance policy. Aside from planning their education and making sure you have enough resources to keep them clothed and fed, most new parents don\'t realise that a child\'s health care requirements can rival that of an adult\'s! In fact, a parent often has to spend the most on a child\'s welfare during his or her growing years. An insurance policy is helpful when it comes to the cost of:\r\n\r\n<strong>General dental</strong> - no one wants to countenance the prospect of a tooth extraction for an 8 year old child. This feature is included under extras cover and usually encompasses periodic checkups, preventative measures, x-rays and fillings.\r\n\r\n<strong>Optical</strong> – Medicare may cover eye tests, but private cover takes care of measures to correct a child\'s eyesight, i.e. spectacle frames, lenses/contact lenses.\r\n\r\n<strong>Orthodontic</strong> – braces are a common feature for almost every child today. Orthodontic flaws is best corrected in youth because good results are easier to achieve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Physiotherapy</strong> – a health insurance policy helps a family afford the necessary treatment if a child has the misfortune of being afflicted with developmental or neurological impairments.\r\n\r\n<strong>Podiatry</strong> – abnormalities in the feet (e.g. flat feet, pigeon toeing) can be remedied quickly and effectively at younger ages\r\n<h2>Considerations for Single Parents</h2>\r\nBeing a single parent isn\'t an excuse not to make sure your child has health insurance. Where they previously had to pay the same premiums as policy-holders who bought couples insurance prior to 2007, single parents now pay only for what they and the child need, which is a reduction of up to 25% compared to the premiums a couple would pay.\r\n\r\nThis recognition of a single-parent family doesn\'t mean that cover is compromised either – a single parent has the option of considering cover for pregnancy and related services as well as assisted reproductive services.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance should be a priority where children are concerned, whether you\'re having your first child or adding another one to the brood. As with many of life\'s other issues, making arrangements well in advance of the impending event, rather than later, is always better.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:65:\"Health Insurance for Children: Making Sure Your Family is Covered\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:64:\"health-insurance-for-children-making-sure-your-family-is-covered\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 08:01:18\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 08:01:18\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=64\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:6;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:67;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-11-08 15:04:22\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-11-08 15:04:22\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:0:\"\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:3:\"HBF\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:3:\"hbf\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-08-31 02:40:28\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-08-31 02:40:28\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=67\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:7;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:110;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2011-02-10 02:35:02\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2011-02-10 02:35:02\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:3635:\"Private health insurance provides a way to bridge Medicare gaps. This type of health care kicks in when the government won’t pay for a treatment or examination. Essentially, there are two types of private health care including hospital and general treatment. Some private health care policies cover both types while other policies only cover one or the other.\r\n<h2>Hospital Coverage</h2>\r\nHospital coverage includes hospital stays, treatments, surgeries, and most other things associated with an in-patient hospital visit. Plastic surgery and other superficial surgeries are rarely covered by private health care. Three different types of hospital coverage exist, and each type varies drastically.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Top 	Private Coverage: this type of plan does not include any 	restrictions.</li>\r\n	<li>Medium 	Private Coverage: medium coverage plans do not exclude any items on 	the Medicare Benefits Schedule, though some restrictions do exist.</li>\r\n	<li>Basic 	Coverage: while less expensive, basic coverage almost always comes 	with at least one restriction and one exclusion.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nDeciding which type of coverage to sign up for can be tricky. Top coverage is the best kind of coverage available, though you’ll wind up paying for a lack of restrictions or exclusions. Medium coverage is tolerable if you can live with some basic restrictions. Basic coverage should only be considered if the one exclusion and restriction are not of importance. As with any other kind of insurance, it’s best to comb through each policy offered by private insurers before buying any kind of coverage.\r\n<h2>General Treatment Coverage</h2>\r\nNot all conditions, illnesses, and pains require in-hospital treatment. Ancillary treatments are covered through general treatment plans. Optical, dental, and any other kind of extra treatment is typically covered by a general treatment plan. As with hospital coverage, there are three different types of general treatment coverage.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Comprehensive 	Coverage: this is the cream of the general treatment coverage crop. 	Almost all ancillary treatments are covered through comprehensive 	plans.</li>\r\n	<li>Medium 	Coverage: this type of coverage includes nearly every type of 	ancillary treatment, though it does not usually include hearing 	aids, orthodontics, and various other types of treatment (check each 	policy carefully).</li>\r\n	<li>Basic 	Coverage: basic coverage provides, well, basic ancillary care. One 	chiropractic, optical, dental, and physiotherapy session is covered.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAs with hospital coverage, comprehensive coverage is the best possible option. Medium coverage can be useful if you only plan on receiving ancillary treatments occasionally. Basic coverage is better than no coverage at all, but it is not the best possible option.\r\n<h2>Hospital, Ancillary, or Both?</h2>\r\nWhile most health funds combine hospital and ancillary treatments, you are not stuck with a package deal. Various funds also offer mix and match options. If you want to have more hospital coverage and less general treatment coverage, you can opt for top private hospital coverage and a basic general treatment plan. Finding a fund that is flexible is the best way to gain all of the coverage that you need.\r\n\r\nTaking the time to browse various plans is the best course of action. While private health insurance is almost always necessary, there are many different plans to select from. You may find that a complete health care package provides you with what you need.

He or she may also miss out on family health benefits that a major employer provides. So, to make up for this loss of benefit, the self-employed may be successful in getting the self-employed health insurance premium that is accepted as a legitimate business expense.\r\n\r\nA self-employed individual has the flexibility of selecting the type of insurance based on the coverage as well as the deductibles and co-payments to meet individual needs. In other words, the self-employed individual is free from the constraints faced by employees on a group plan in which coverage is chosen by the employer.\r\n\r\nIf you are leaving a job to start your own business, attempt to continue with the group plan benefits for the specified period. In the meantime, you should look for online quotes from several health insurance companies before making your choice. While you can choose to opt for an individual private health insurance plan or continue with an existing one, it is advisable to purchase one that is geared towards your status as a self-employed individual as this type of insurance is specifically targeted towards those in business rather than employees. Hence, the type of cover is more comprehensive and relevant to your status as a self-employed person and to your business.\r\n\r\nThe following steps on finding the right policy especially for the self-employed may guide you to make a decision:\r\n<h2>Figure out your specific needs</h2>\r\nAll individuals have specific needs and that must be covered so always consider those needs when figuring out the best health insurance for you. Do you get sick a lot? Do you only need to go to the doctor in emergencies? Do you have chronic illness that needs constant treatment like remedial massage or chiropractic service?\r\n\r\nOnce your needs are determined you\'ll have a much less difficult time sifting through the available health insurance plans.\r\n<h2>What is your budget?</h2>\r\nMedical bills and doctor\'s visits can be extremely expensive so if you are not covered under a health insurance plan it will cost you a small fortune to pay for minor services like consultation and checkups. Hence, choosing the proper plan for your healthcare needs is important.\r\n\r\nYou may need to consider the following when choosing a self-employed health care plan:\r\n\r\n<strong>A)</strong> Make sure you know exactly what you need coverage for and make sure that is a part of the plan you choose.\r\n\r\n<strong>B)</strong> Recognise the importance of being able to choose your own doctor and/or to stay with the doctor you currently go to right now since a relationship and a high level of trust between you and your doctor have been established. Also ensure that you get quick access to in-hospital treatment such as surgery.\r\n<h2>Apply for Quotes and do comparison shopping</h2>\r\nNow your final step is to sign up for a service that will give you several health insurance quotes, hence enabling you to easily find the best individual health insurance for you. Look through the quotes you receive, study the companies and the plans so you know what you are paying for. Most importantly, look at the find print thoroughly to ascertain what the plan covers or does not cover.\r\n\r\nIf you don\'t have health insurance, you are at risk of losing a lot more if you get into an accident, get injured or are taken in by a sudden illness.\r\n\r\nIn a nut shell, the advantages of private health insurance for the self-employed are early diagnosis of health problems, prompt access to treatment, choice of admission time, date and place and prompt assistance and access to information. This is a crucial factor as treatment is done without conflict with business commitments. Self-employed health insurance policies can also offer a more extensive cover not available on individual health policies.\r\n\r\nIt is fundamental for self-employed people to get health cover specially designed for their status so that they can be treated speedily by doctors of their choice and get back on their feet to resume their business as quickly as possible. Most importantly, they get the type of cover that is more relevant to their needs such as protecting financial loss while being treated for their injury or illness.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:47:\"Health Insurance for the Self-Employed: A Guide\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:46:\"health-insurance-for-the-self-employed-a-guide\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 08:05:33\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 08:05:33\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:46:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=146\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}}s:10:\"post_count\";i:10;s:12:\"current_post\";i:-1;s:11:\"in_the_loop\";b:0;s:4:\"post\";r:107;s:8:\"comments\";N;s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:15:\"current_comment\";i:-1;s:7:\"comment\";N;s:11:\"found_posts\";s:3:\"381\";s:13:\"max_num_pages\";d:39;s:21:\"max_num_comment_pages\";i:0;s:9:\"is_single\";b:0;s:10:\"is_preview\";b:0;s:7:\"is_page\";b:0;s:10:\"is_archive\";b:0;s:7:\"is_date\";b:0;s:7:\"is_year\";b:0;s:8:\"is_month\";b:0;s:6:\"is_day\";b:0;s:7:\"is_time\";b:0;s:9:\"is_author\";b:0;s:11:\"is_category\";b:0;s:6:\"is_tag\";b:0;s:6:\"is_tax\";b:0;s:9:\"is_search\";b:0;s:7:\"is_feed\";b:0;s:15:\"is_comment_feed\";b:0;s:12:\"is_trackback\";b:0;s:7:\"is_home\";b:0;s:6:\"is_404\";b:0;s:8:\"is_embed\";b:0;s:8:\"is_paged\";b:0;s:8:\"is_admin\";b:1;s:13:\"is_attachment\";b:0;s:11:\"is_singular\";b:0;s:9:\"is_robots\";b:0;s:13:\"is_posts_page\";b:0;s:20:\"is_post_type_archive\";b:0;s:25:\"\0WP_Query\0query_vars_hash\";s:32:\"d8ec62dcc0e5fd4bb0ff1d64ba1196e2\";s:28:\"\0WP_Query\0query_vars_changed\";b:0;s:17:\"thumbnails_cached\";b:0;s:19:\"\0WP_Query\0stopwords\";N;s:23:\"\0WP_Query\0compat_fields\";a:2:{i:0;s:15:\"query_vars_hash\";i:1;s:18:\"query_vars_changed\";}s:24:\"\0WP_Query\0compat_methods\";a:2:{i:0;s:16:\"init_query_flags\";i:1;s:15:\"parse_tax_query\";}}s:11:\"export_type\";s:8:\"specific\";s:21:\"filter_rules_hierarhy\";s:2:\"[]\";s:21:\"product_matching_mode\";s:6:\"strict\";s:17:\"wp_query_selector\";s:8:\"wp_query\";s:18:\"taxonomy_to_export\";s:0:\"\";s:18:\"created_at_version\";s:5:\"1.2.0\";s:18:\"is_loaded_template\";s:0:\"\";s:18:\"order_item_per_row\";i:1;s:29:\"order_item_fill_empty_columns\";i:1;s:8:\"filepath\";s:89:\"/wpallexport/exports/75df2b104bbd9a3db348258c7201c73a/Posts-Export-2018-March-01-0500.csv\";s:16:\"current_filepath\";s:129:\"/var/www/hic3/wp-content/uploads/wpallexport/exports/75df2b104bbd9a3db348258c7201c73a/current-Posts-Export-2018-March-01-0500.csv\";s:10:\"bundlepath\";s:89:\"/wpallexport/exports/75df2b104bbd9a3db348258c7201c73a/Posts-Export-2018-March-01-0500.zip\";s:8:\"wp_query\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"export_to\";s:3:\"csv\";s:15:\"export_to_sheet\";s:3:\"csv\";s:9:\"delimiter\";s:1:\",\";s:8:\"encoding\";s:5:\"UTF-8\";s:21:\"is_generate_templates\";i:1;s:18:\"is_generate_import\";i:1;s:9:\"import_id\";i:0;s:13:\"template_name\";s:34:\"Posts Export -

A greater reluctance to pay out of pocket for health care expenses has seen a greater awareness of the benefits of health insurance. As with many other facilities, there are both private and public options.\r\n\r\n<strong> Medicare – The Public Option </strong>\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1984, Medicare ensures that all Australians have access to free treatment at public hospitals. Medicare benefits also include treatment from specialists, general practitioners, dentists and optometrists who participate in the scheme for free or subsidised fees.\r\n\r\nParticipating dentists and optometrists can render particular services only, as described by the Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS), while the cost of other general, or ancillary treatments has to be borne by the patient. Prescription medication is also greatly subsidised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that comes under the Medicare umbrella. In short, Medicare means:\r\n\r\n- free admission to a public hospital and care, treatment and after-care from nominated health care providers\r\n\r\n- the possibility of being liable (paying out of pocket) for hospital accommodation, fees for operation theater use and medication.\r\n\r\nMedicare provides such services based on tax contributions from all Australians, as well as an extra levy imposed on those earning a high income. For single people, this threshold is $73,000 for the year 2009-10, while couples with a combined income of $143,000 and above are subject to the Medicare- levy. Low-income earners are not required to contribute to Medicare.\r\n\r\n<strong> Eligibility For Medicare </strong>\r\n\r\nAustralian residents are eligible for this public health insurance scheme as long as they are Australian or New Zealand citizens, hold permanent (Australian) visas or have applied for one, although terms and conditions may apply.\r\n\r\nIndividuals whose citizenship status is less clear cut may also have to submit documents supporting their Australian residency.\r\n\r\n<strong>Private health insurance </strong>\r\n\r\nAnother option for Australians is private health insurance, obtained courtesy of private health insurance providers, or funds. The largest and most well known of these is Medibank Private, a government- owned fund that follows the same regulations as other private health funds.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the norms in America, Australian health insurance premiums aren\'t determined by age, health, address or even medical history. Private health funds in Australia fall in to the following categories:\r\n\r\n- for-profit: such as MBF Health Fund, or the Health Insurance Fund of Australia\r\n\r\n- non-profit: such as HCF Health Insurance or GMHBA\r\n\r\n- regional: such as HBF, which provides for residents of Western Australia, or the Territory Insurance  Office, which caters to the Northern Territory\r\n\r\nA person can determine which private health fund to opt for by comparing policies online. Those who subscribe to private funds have a wider range of health care options compared to those on Medicare. Based on the premiums paid, an individual can opt to have the fund take care of out of pocket expenses that aren\'t already covered by Medicare.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Importance of Being Community-Rated </strong>\r\n\r\nAll private funds may not refuse a person a policy or subscription based on the following factors:\r\n\r\n- race\r\n\r\n- religion\r\n\r\n- gender\r\n\r\n- job\r\n\r\n- sexual orientation\r\n\r\n- hobbies\r\n\r\nA community-rated fund ensures that all potential subscribers may purchase policies at the same rates or premiums and enjoy the same benefits as others who subscribe to the same plan. Inter-state premiums may exist for a particular product, but intra-state differences are forbidden.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Waiting Game </strong>\r\n\r\nWhile private funds may extend more comprehensive health coverage to subscribers, private health insurers may also impose a waiting period of up to one year at their discretion, especially where preexisting ailments (PEA) are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe period is imposed in order to minimise the risk that a fund may attract profit-seeking subscribers, whose presence may impact on other subscribers in the form of higher premiums and/or fewer benefits. It can also apply to new memberships or existing subscribers who want to upgrade their cover.\r\n\r\nA waiting period prolongs the duration an individual has to wait to receive benefits for a claim. For individuals with PEA or an obstetric condition, it means that the fund will not pay out claims for the first 12 months of the policy. Medical practitioners define PEA as an illness or ailment that existed 6 months before subscription or upgrading.\r\n\r\n<strong> The Push for Private Insurance Policies </strong>\r\n\r\nThe following schemes are designed to encourage Australians to purchase private health insurance instead of relying solely on Medicare or paying out of pocket, and much earlier:\r\n\r\nLifetime health cover – an individual is liable for an annual “loading” fee of 2% if he or she takes out private hospital, not ancillary, coverage on the first July after they are 30 years of age. This means that a span of 5 years will see an individual paying a total of 10% more for health insurance premiums, but only for the first ten years following the initial subscription.\r\n\r\nPrivate health insurance rebate – subscribers to private health insurance policies, both ancillary and hospital, stand to enjoy government subsidies on premiums paid on a sliding scale.\r\n\r\nMedicare levy surcharge – single individuals whose taxable income exceeds $73,000 or couples whose combined income exceeds $140,000 who don\'t have private health insurance face a surcharge of 1% in addition to the 1.5% Medicare tax when it comes to health care fees. In this aspect, a private hospital policy is a more affordable and beneficial alternative.\r\n\r\nGoing to the doctor is never an enjoyable experience, and it\'s fortunate a person has to option of turning to health insurance to meet the expense. In addition to being proportionate to the income earned, a person\'s health insurance policy should cover his or her needs comprehensively.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:42:\"Health Insurance in Australia: An Overview\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:41:\"health-insurance-in-australia-an-overview\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 09:24:50\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 09:24:50\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:44:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=3\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:1;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:8;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-10-16 08:35:18\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-16 08:35:18\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:5666:\"Purchasing a private health insurance policy is not a decision that can be made lightly. A policy at odds with your needs may mean having to pay slightly more out of pocket for treatment at the very least. At worst, it may mean discovering that the policy whose premiums you\'ve faithfully paid all these years actually doesn\'t cover the procedure for which you\'re being hospitalised.\n\nComparing policies from different private health funds isn\'t as simple as determining whose premiums are lower, although that certainly helps. There are also other aspects a consumer should keep in mind when comparing policies, whether with an online tool or plain, old-fashioned enquiries to ensure apples aren\'t being compared to oranges.\n<h2>Pay For Only What You Need</h2>\nMany consumers believe that they have no choice but to accept whatever policy a health fund offers, when the opposite is actually true. Tailor-making a policy is a surefire way of ensuring that a person in his or her twenties doesn\'t have to pay for a knee replacement, whereas a senior citizen would certainly look at insurance for cardio-thoracic procedures instead of that for obstetrics.\n\nPaying only for an essential coverage policy means that a person has to evaluate his or her policy from time to time. This should be done to ensure coverage of the needs most relevant to the person and their family at that particular time and reap the most benefits from premiums paid.\n<h2>Types of Health Insurance to Consider</h2>\nComparing health insurance policies means knowing exactly what you get with the following covers:\n\n<strong>Hospital</strong> – a person can claim reimbursement from a fund for the cost of accommodation, treatment and ambulance transport to a private hospital.\n\n<strong>Extras</strong> – these include medical services not rendered in a hospital environment and which Medicare doesn\'t cover, including optical, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy and alternative treatment as well as ambulance transport.\n\n<strong>Hospital-extras</strong> – this combines the best of hospital and extras cover for optimum general coverage, and are usually offered together with another policy.\n<h2>See What Profile You Fit</h2>\nMost consumers fall in to the following categories, from which a health policy that meets their needs most accurately can be rendered:\n\n<strong>Young and single</strong> – young to middle-aged couples who already have children and have no plans to expand the family. Cover for people in this profile tends toward hospital cover for general procedures that include optical, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy treatment.\n\n<strong>Young couples/family with/without obstetrics</strong> – people fitting this profile are young to middle-aged couples planning to have children. The profile also includes couples who intend to add to their existing family. People like this are more interested in in vitro fertilisation (IVF)/obstetrics and hospital and extras cover than that for knee replacement or open heart surgery.\n\n<strong>Young family, with obstetrics</strong> – includes young/middle-aged couples with young children don\'t intend to extend the family. These growing families are more interested in a wide range of cover for hospital and extra fees to cater to post-natal care and young children.\n\n<strong>Older families</strong> – encompasses established families that tend to comprise older couples and dependent offspring, i.e. those aged below 18. Families like these are less interested in obstetrics and IVF and are more concerned with braces for the children and cardio-thoracic cover for the parents. Cover for these families also tends to include that for optical, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy treatment. Young to middle-aged single parents also tend to focus on policies that cover these concerns.\n\n<strong>Mature singles/couples</strong> – individuals or couples who have never had, or no longer have dependent children worry more about their ability to meet the cost of knee/hip replacements or multi-focal lenses, as well as extras cover that encompasses optical, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy treatment. There is little or no concern for obstetrics, IVF or post-natal cover in this profile.\n<h2>Mind the Gap</h2>\nA gap is the out of pocket expense a consumer must pay when the amount paid out by a private health fund is less than the cost of a specific medical procedure or service. The gap doesn\'t exist for up to 80% of such services/procedures, but a consumer shouldn\'t take it for granted when comparing health insurance policies from different funds.\n\nDetermining if a gap exists, as well as the difference, before purchasing a policy can do a lot to put a person\'s mind at ease when he or she has to undergo hospitalisation or hospital treatment.\n<h2>How Wide is Coverage?</h2>\nPreviously, private health funds covered the treatment costs only when a person was admitted to hospital, even though the same treatment could have been rendered in a non-hospital environment. Now though, there are funds whose hospital cover extends to medical treatment received at home, such as dialysis or diabetes management. This flexibility opens up a wider range of treatment options to a patient.\n\nThese are not the only aspects to consider when comparing policies from different funds. Other factors such as employment type (e.g. medical, education, rail and transport) may also make a person eligible for a more beneficial health insurance policy. Although there is no such thing as a universal health insurance policy, a person can obtain a more thorough comparison by providing relevant, comprehensive information.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:46:\"An Introduction to Health Insurance Comparison\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:46:\"an-introduction-to-health-insurance-comparison\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2010-10-16 08:35:18\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-16 08:35:18\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:44:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=8\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:2;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:11;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-10-17 04:37:19\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-17 04:37:19\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:4479:\"Health care premiums are monthly payments rendered to insurers for the purchase of health insurance – a form of insurance which covers illness, injury and other medical expenses. Premiums function as the chief source of revenue for health insurance providers. Insurance company actuaries consider a range of factors in determining these premiums.\n\nSuch factors would include the cost of payment to healthcare practitioners, advertisements, and sales and profit margins. Consumers, however, are also able to determine the cost of their insurance premiums to some degree. The ten factors that can impact health insurance premiums are discussed below.\n<h2>Varying Options From Varying Funds</h2>\nTo ensure that you are getting the best value for your money given your needs and circumstances, it is recommended that you compare all your options from different funds before committing to a health fund. An informed decision will likely save you money on your premiums.\n<h2>Get An Early Start</h2>\nDepending on your age, if you are eligible for Medicare benefits, then you could receive up to 34% in rebate from the Federal government to help you with the cost of your private health insurance premium. Further, if you opt for hospital cover before your thirtieth birthday (or the first July following it), then you will be eligible for the lowest base rate health insurance premiums.\n<h2>Deductibles Can Vary</h2>\nThis is the annual amount that you pay out of pocket before being reimbursed for any medical expenses incurred. These tend to vary from one policy to another, and the higher the deductible that is paid, the lower your premium becomes in the end.\n<h2><strong>Co-payment </strong></h2>\nWith co-payment, policyholders pay a set amount daily every time a medical service is provided. For example, a co-payment clause in a policy may require a patient to pay the first $50 for private hospital accommodation each day. Therefore, a person is able to reduce his or her premiums by agreeing to co-payment on health insurance.\n<h2>Excess</h2>\nSome funds offer hospital cover for which there is “excess”. This is the amount paid when a person is admitted in to a private hospital. It is usually paid once and covers hospital admissions for that year, although some funds may stipulate that it may apply to each admission. The sum, however, is typically larger than what a person would pay for co-payment. Both co-payment and excess are ideal if you are relatively healthy as they reduce the amount of premium you would have to pay.\n<h2>Exclusion</h2>\nBy excluding benefits for certain forms of treatment – for example, maternity treatment or knee replacements, a policyholder will pay a lower premium. However, policies with exclusions will not cover a patient being treated for the relevant condition.\n<h2>Restricted Benefits</h2>\nA policy with restricted benefits will grant a person coverage for treatment in a public hospital, but only some of the costs will be covered if a person opts to receive treatment in a private hospital.\n<h2>Benefit Limitation Period</h2>\nA limitation period entitles a person to restricted benefits for particular conditions or treatment during a stipulated time period. For example, you could take out an insurance policy that pays full benefits for several conditions but only offers restricted benefits for hip replacement surgery for the first 3 years of the policy. After 3 years, you will be entitled to full benefits. Taking a policy with a benefit limitation period will reduce premiums.\n<h2>Advance Payment</h2>\nPremium rates could rise up to 5% every year to compensate for ever increasing medical costs. The majority of health insurance providers allow you to pay your premiums in advance to take advantage of the previous year\'s rates for the following 12 months, thus saving you some money.\n<h2>Going Abroad</h2>\nIf you will be traveling or living abroad for an extended period (longer than a few weeks but less than 2 years), some health funds will permit you to suspend membership for that period so that you do not incur increased premiums while you are away. You will be able to restart membership without additional waiting periods on your return.\n\nPolicies vary between different providers, so it is always best to consult with the relevant hospitals and your health fund first before making any decisions. But by following some of the guidelines above, you are guaranteed the best value and savings on your premiums.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:36:\"10 Factors That Impact Your Premiums\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:36:\"10-factors-that-impact-your-premiums\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2010-10-17 04:37:19\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-17 04:37:19\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=11\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:3;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:52;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-10-24 11:48:31\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-10-24 11:48:31\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:4728:\"Thanks to excellent weather and fantastic healthcare facilities, it\'s no wonder that Australia exerts as much attraction for overseas professionals as Western Europe and the United States do.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary concerns for foreigners working in Australia is obtaining health insurance. Most of the time, the company you work for will take care of it, but other times, the mantle of responsibility falls on the individual\'s shoulders, especially if he or she is an entrepreneur. Aside from comparing quotes and plans from different health insurers, or health funds, there are a few aspects an expat has to consider about his or her health insurance.\r\n<h2>Is Medicare Enough?</h2>\r\nWorkers who stay for more than a few months in Australia are eligible to apply for Medicare, the country\'s own healthcare system that coexists with the private healthcare. It is funded by up to 1.5% of taxpayers\' income, depending on the income tier the individual falls under.\r\n\r\nUnder Medicare, the majority of patients enjoy 100% cover of in-patient care and about 75% primary care charges at a public hospital. However, should a person choose to be admitted to a private hospital, Medicare will only cover the costs equivalent to that of a public facility, and the patient has to make up the shortfall. Additionally, there may be an age limit for Medicare applicants, which leads to private health funds being another avenue of assistance to which expats can turn.\r\n<h2>“Topping Up” with Private Health Insurance <strong>\r\n</strong></h2>\r\nAside from covering hospitalisation fees only up to that incurred in a public hospital (if admission is sought in a private facility), Medicare does not provide coverage for dental and optical care, as well as ambulance transport. These expenses may be mitigated with the use of a Low Income Earner Card, but most expats would be ineligible for this.\r\n\r\nA private health insurance policy would provide more comprehensive health management plans, and can be tailored to meet an individual\'s needs more closely. As a financial incentive, all taxpayers stand to gain up to 25% rebate if they have private health cover. The rebate can be a tax rebate or insurance premium discount. Individuals may also collect a refund from Medicare offices. As with Australian citizens, expats aged 65-69 and over 70 years stand to enjoy rebates of 30% and 34% respectively.\r\n<h2>Putting Yourself First</h2>\r\nA further incentive for expats to purchase private health cover is the Australian government\'s imposition of a higher Medicare Levy Surcharge for high income earners who do not already have private health insurance.\r\n\r\nThe definition of “high income” is based on a threshold amount and can be subject to revision. Rather than pay for health benefits for other people, most, if not all, income-earners would prefer to spend more money on themselves.\r\n<h2>Choosing A Health Fund</h2>\r\nWhile the rebate is an attractive incentive to purchase private health cover, an expat buying his or her own insurance should be aware that the health fund must be registered inside the federal scheme in order for it to qualify for tax rebates.\r\n\r\nThe expat should also determine the extent a health fund will cover healthcare fees. While most private funds may cover the costs that Medicare doesn\'t meet, some will pay the Medicare rate if a policyholder is admitted to a private hospital. Having to pay out-of-pocket in this manner thus defeats the purpose of buying health insurance in the first place.\r\n<h2>Dealing with Brokers</h2>\r\nInsurance brokers can be consulted if an expat desires full/comprehensive private cover outside of Medicare. Whether you\'re ineligible for Medicare or just want full cover anyway, you need to know what you can afford and what you consider necessary benefits.\r\n\r\nThis means having full comprehension of what is and isn\'t covered by the policy, in addition to aspects of the cover that you simply don\'t require, such as obstetrics if you\'re a single male with no plans on settling down. Helpful features to look out for include rapid settlement of claims, e.g. in 14 days, a multilingual helpline accessible 24/7 and whether cover for accidents and injuries are included in the policy.\r\n\r\nA broker can represent more than one health fund as well, so it\'s easier to find a policy that best suits you from one who has a wide network.\r\n\r\nAs with other rapidly-expanding economies, the Australian government is supportive of the influx of skilled workers to sustain trade. This, combined with the need for private health cover and a large number of health funds that keep premiums affordable, means purchasing private health insurance is an attractive prospect for the expatriate worker.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:58:\"Health Insurance: What An Expat in Australia Needs to Know\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:15:\"expat-insurance\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 07:48:12\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 07:48:12\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=52\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:4;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:59;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-11-01 09:33:24\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-11-01 09:33:24\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:5492:\"Purchasing a health insurance policy may seem quite a daunting experience when you consider the phrases bandied about. This alphabetically-arranged glossary aims to explain some of the more commonly used terms.\n\n<strong>Acute Care Certificate</strong> – This applies to long-term patients and is granted by the treating doctor. Health funds are relieved of the obligation to pay for treatment if the certificate is absent.\n\n<strong>Admission</strong> – A person must be admitted by a doctor to be treated as a private patient in a registered private, public or day hospital. Emergency treatment at a private hospital is not an admission.\n\n<strong>Agreement/Participating Hospital</strong> – A hospital that has a partner agreement with a health fund to ensure complete health cover for particular accommodation and operating theatre fees, ensuring out of pocket costs are kept to a minimum for members. Each health fund has a different list of participating hospitals, and admission to non-participating hospitals may mean a patient has to pay out-of-pocket costs.\n\n<strong>Alternative Therapies</strong> – Includes treatment via Alexander technique, acupuncture, aromatherapy, Bowen technique, Chinese medicine, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, massage, kinesiology, myotherapy, reflexology, naturopathy, shiatsu, remedial massage and western herbalism.\n\n<strong>Ancillary/Extras Cover</strong> – Includes dental, chiropractic, physiotherapy, optical, pharmacy and alternative therapies (described above) that Medicare doesn\'t cover.\n\n<strong>Annual Limit</strong> – The maximum benefit a person can receive for a specific treatment in a year and applies after the waiting period has been served.\n\n<strong>Benefits</strong> – Covers claims for treatment received at hospitals and is the minimum amount, as defined by the government, that health funds must cover.\n\n<strong>Benefit Limitation Periods</strong> – Allows a health fund member to enjoy lower insurance premiums by restricting the benefits a member can claim for treatment of specific conditions, e.g. being eligible for full knee replacement surgery benefits only after 3 years\' cover, despite the treatment\'s standard 12-month waiting period.\n\n<strong>Calendar and Membership Years</strong> – A membership year begins on the day a member joins the fund, whereas a calendar year spans January 1 to December 31. Some funds may use the terms interchangeably, so it\'s advisable to clarify this in the beginning.\n\n<strong>Change of Cover</strong> – Refers to up- or downgrading of a health policy. Members should check if this action will affect any waiting periods to be served prior to becoming eligible for benefit claims.\n\n<strong>Community Rating</strong> – Ensures that all individuals are entitled to purchase the same health insurance policy at the same price, with the guaranteed right to renew said policy. A health fund cannot refuse to insure any individual on health grounds.\n\n<strong>Compensation and Damages from Others</strong> – Refers to compensation and/or damages that can be claimed from compulsory third party insurance, worker\'s compensation, common law, travel insurance, sports insurance, crimes compensation and litigation.\n\n<strong>Co-Payment</strong> – The amount a member agrees to pay for the cost of hospital admission.\n\n<strong>Dependants</strong> – Defined as children and students (full-time) under 25 years living at home with no dependents of their own.\n\n<strong>Excess</strong> – The amount a member agrees to pay for each hospital admission before benefits are paid out. Members tend to opt for higher excess to maintain lower premiums.\n\n<strong>Exclusions</strong> – Hospital procedures (public or private) for which a member will not receive payment.\n\n<strong>Gap/Out-of-Pocket Expenses</strong> – The difference that exists between the fees charged by doctors and the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee.\n\n<strong>General Treatment Cover</strong> – Covers non-hospital medical services excluded by Medicare, e.g. optical, dental, physiotherapy, other therapy and ambulance.\n\n<strong>Medicare Levy Surcharge</strong> – A surcharge imposed by the government for those who don\'t have hospital cover. Obtaining even basic hospital cover is usually cheaper than paying an additional 1% on taxable income.\n\n<strong>Restricted Benefits</strong> – Refers to a policy that provides fewer/limited benefits and the minimum payout for specific treatments in “exchange” for lower premiums. Often, members have to pay for theatre fees, same day theatre or intensive and coronary care units.\n\n<strong>Waiting Period</strong> – The duration a member has to wait after joining a health fund to become eligible for benefits. Waiting periods may vary with each health fund.\n\n<strong>Rebate</strong> – Health fund members are entitled to this rebate, which can be claimed a discount on premiums paid or claimed as a rebate on an annual tax return. It is based on income and there are differing rebate levels depending on age and income.\n\nThis list is just a small section of the terms used in private health insurance today. As each health fund may possess its own terms, it\'s always best to ask for clarification before committing to a health insurance policy.\n<h4><span id=\"DisclaimerThe_above_information_is_correct_and_current_at_the_time_of_publication\">Disclaimer: The above information is correct and current at the time of publication.</span></h4>\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:46:\"Knowing the Lingo: A Health Insurance Glossary\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:47:\"knowing-the-lingo-a-health-insurance-glossary-2\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2010-11-01 09:33:24\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-11-01 09:33:24\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=59\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:5;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:64;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-11-05 09:26:40\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-11-05 09:26:40\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:4845:\"Finding out you\'re about to become a parent is one of the most thrilling, yet unnerving experiences you could ever hope to have. A person\'s life usually becomes a whirlwind of planning from the moment you get the (good) news from the doctor to the minute labour begins. Not only is there a nursery to prepare and an education fund to build, it would be remiss for any prospective parent to neglect planning for the new arrival\'s health insurance.\r\n<h2>Couples vs. Family Health Insurance</h2>\r\nIf you\'ve never given much thought to family health insurance because you already have couples insurance, it\'s definitely time for a rethink! A couples insurance policy provides cover for medical costs incurred for an individual and his or her partner, but it may not include cover for obstetrics and related services.\r\n\r\nMaking sure that the latest addition to the family is included in the health insurance policy is a good way to ensure peace of mind, especially when it comes to the myriad expenses a growing child can run up.\r\n<h2>The Medicare Safety Net May Not Cover It All</h2>\r\nThe Medicare Safety Net would seem to be a failsafe option for couples or individuals with a child on the way. However, it operates on the basis of a family reaching a threshold amount of gap or out-of-pocket payments before you receive benefits for the rest of the calendar year.\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Safety Net and Medicare cover do not provide cover for admission to a private hospital either. Most of the time, births in a private hospital are more unlikely to require intensive care or emergency resuscitation, while births in a public hospital tend to record a higher number of such incidences.\r\n\r\nNot only that, there is a lower incidence of low Apgar scores, neonatal death or injury to women who give birth in private hospitals. Most of the time, comprehensive cover for such maternity and neonatal requirements is available only from private health funds.\r\n<h2>Upgrading An Existing Policy</h2>\r\nWhether you have an existing policy or are thinking of signing up for one before starting a family, most funds advise upgrading or signing up for birth or child-related cover 12 months before the family\'s newest addition arrives.\r\n\r\nThis is because most policies impose a waiting period for obstetric cover that usually spans 12 months. This means that a couple or the individual would have to pay the premiums for the related fund for 12 months before becoming eligible to claim for insurance benefits.\r\n<h2>Getting Help With Expenses</h2>\r\nSome people might question the need to include children in a health insurance policy. Aside from planning their education and making sure you have enough resources to keep them clothed and fed, most new parents don\'t realise that a child\'s health care requirements can rival that of an adult\'s! In fact, a parent often has to spend the most on a child\'s welfare during his or her growing years. An insurance policy is helpful when it comes to the cost of:\r\n\r\n<strong>General dental</strong> - no one wants to countenance the prospect of a tooth extraction for an 8 year old child. This feature is included under extras cover and usually encompasses periodic checkups, preventative measures, x-rays and fillings.\r\n\r\n<strong>Optical</strong> – Medicare may cover eye tests, but private cover takes care of measures to correct a child\'s eyesight, i.e. spectacle frames, lenses/contact lenses.\r\n\r\n<strong>Orthodontic</strong> – braces are a common feature for almost every child today. Orthodontic flaws is best corrected in youth because good results are easier to achieve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Physiotherapy</strong> – a health insurance policy helps a family afford the necessary treatment if a child has the misfortune of being afflicted with developmental or neurological impairments.\r\n\r\n<strong>Podiatry</strong> – abnormalities in the feet (e.g. flat feet, pigeon toeing) can be remedied quickly and effectively at younger ages\r\n<h2>Considerations for Single Parents</h2>\r\nBeing a single parent isn\'t an excuse not to make sure your child has health insurance. Where they previously had to pay the same premiums as policy-holders who bought couples insurance prior to 2007, single parents now pay only for what they and the child need, which is a reduction of up to 25% compared to the premiums a couple would pay.\r\n\r\nThis recognition of a single-parent family doesn\'t mean that cover is compromised either – a single parent has the option of considering cover for pregnancy and related services as well as assisted reproductive services.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance should be a priority where children are concerned, whether you\'re having your first child or adding another one to the brood. As with many of life\'s other issues, making arrangements well in advance of the impending event, rather than later, is always better.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:65:\"Health Insurance for Children: Making Sure Your Family is Covered\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:64:\"health-insurance-for-children-making-sure-your-family-is-covered\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 08:01:18\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 08:01:18\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=64\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:6;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:67;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2010-11-08 15:04:22\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2010-11-08 15:04:22\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:0:\"\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:3:\"HBF\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:3:\"hbf\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-08-31 02:40:28\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-08-31 02:40:28\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:45:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=67\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:7;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:110;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2011-02-10 02:35:02\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2011-02-10 02:35:02\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:3635:\"Private health insurance provides a way to bridge Medicare gaps. This type of health care kicks in when the government won’t pay for a treatment or examination. Essentially, there are two types of private health care including hospital and general treatment. Some private health care policies cover both types while other policies only cover one or the other.\r\n<h2>Hospital Coverage</h2>\r\nHospital coverage includes hospital stays, treatments, surgeries, and most other things associated with an in-patient hospital visit. Plastic surgery and other superficial surgeries are rarely covered by private health care. Three different types of hospital coverage exist, and each type varies drastically.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Top 	Private Coverage: this type of plan does not include any 	restrictions.</li>\r\n	<li>Medium 	Private Coverage: medium coverage plans do not exclude any items on 	the Medicare Benefits Schedule, though some restrictions do exist.</li>\r\n	<li>Basic 	Coverage: while less expensive, basic coverage almost always comes 	with at least one restriction and one exclusion.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nDeciding which type of coverage to sign up for can be tricky. Top coverage is the best kind of coverage available, though you’ll wind up paying for a lack of restrictions or exclusions. Medium coverage is tolerable if you can live with some basic restrictions. Basic coverage should only be considered if the one exclusion and restriction are not of importance. As with any other kind of insurance, it’s best to comb through each policy offered by private insurers before buying any kind of coverage.\r\n<h2>General Treatment Coverage</h2>\r\nNot all conditions, illnesses, and pains require in-hospital treatment. Ancillary treatments are covered through general treatment plans. Optical, dental, and any other kind of extra treatment is typically covered by a general treatment plan. As with hospital coverage, there are three different types of general treatment coverage.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Comprehensive 	Coverage: this is the cream of the general treatment coverage crop. 	Almost all ancillary treatments are covered through comprehensive 	plans.</li>\r\n	<li>Medium 	Coverage: this type of coverage includes nearly every type of 	ancillary treatment, though it does not usually include hearing 	aids, orthodontics, and various other types of treatment (check each 	policy carefully).</li>\r\n	<li>Basic 	Coverage: basic coverage provides, well, basic ancillary care. One 	chiropractic, optical, dental, and physiotherapy session is covered.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAs with hospital coverage, comprehensive coverage is the best possible option. Medium coverage can be useful if you only plan on receiving ancillary treatments occasionally. Basic coverage is better than no coverage at all, but it is not the best possible option.\r\n<h2>Hospital, Ancillary, or Both?</h2>\r\nWhile most health funds combine hospital and ancillary treatments, you are not stuck with a package deal. Various funds also offer mix and match options. If you want to have more hospital coverage and less general treatment coverage, you can opt for top private hospital coverage and a basic general treatment plan. Finding a fund that is flexible is the best way to gain all of the coverage that you need.\r\n\r\nTaking the time to browse various plans is the best course of action. While private health insurance is almost always necessary, there are many different plans to select from. You may find that a complete health care package provides you with what you need. Alternately, you may discover that mixing and matching various policies is the only way to gain the best of both worlds.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:46:\"Types of Private Health Insurance: An Overview\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:45:\"types-of-private-health-insurance-an-overview\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 09:05:20\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 09:05:20\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:46:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=110\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:8;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:133;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"2\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2016-11-28 10:05:20\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:0:\"\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:4:\"Home\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:5:\"draft\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2016-11-28 10:05:20\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:53:\"http://quotes.healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=133\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}i:9;O:7:\"WP_Post\":24:{s:2:\"ID\";i:146;s:11:\"post_author\";s:1:\"1\";s:9:\"post_date\";s:19:\"2011-05-01 01:20:23\";s:13:\"post_date_gmt\";s:19:\"2011-05-01 01:20:23\";s:12:\"post_content\";s:4879:\"[caption id=\"attachment_312\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"462\" caption=\"Image by Shimelle Laine\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-312\" title=\"Self employment\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/877913815_352df2cf79.jpg\" alt=\"Self employment\" width=\"462\" height=\"312\" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nSelf-employed individuals are often at a disadvantage when it comes to private health insurance as reasonably priced ones are often made available only through an employer-sponsored group plan.\r\n\r\nThe self-employed also do not get to enjoy the benefit of having some or all of the employee health insurance premiums written off by employers of their taxable income in a group health plan.  He or she may also miss out on family health benefits that a major employer provides. So, to make up for this loss of benefit, the self-employed may be successful in getting the self-employed health insurance premium that is accepted as a legitimate business expense.\r\n\r\nA self-employed individual has the flexibility of selecting the type of insurance based on the coverage as well as the deductibles and co-payments to meet individual needs. In other words, the self-employed individual is free from the constraints faced by employees on a group plan in which coverage is chosen by the employer.\r\n\r\nIf you are leaving a job to start your own business, attempt to continue with the group plan benefits for the specified period. In the meantime, you should look for online quotes from several health insurance companies before making your choice. While you can choose to opt for an individual private health insurance plan or continue with an existing one, it is advisable to purchase one that is geared towards your status as a self-employed individual as this type of insurance is specifically targeted towards those in business rather than employees. Hence, the type of cover is more comprehensive and relevant to your status as a self-employed person and to your business.\r\n\r\nThe following steps on finding the right policy especially for the self-employed may guide you to make a decision:\r\n<h2>Figure out your specific needs</h2>\r\nAll individuals have specific needs and that must be covered so always consider those needs when figuring out the best health insurance for you. Do you get sick a lot? Do you only need to go to the doctor in emergencies? Do you have chronic illness that needs constant treatment like remedial massage or chiropractic service?\r\n\r\nOnce your needs are determined you\'ll have a much less difficult time sifting through the available health insurance plans.\r\n<h2>What is your budget?</h2>\r\nMedical bills and doctor\'s visits can be extremely expensive so if you are not covered under a health insurance plan it will cost you a small fortune to pay for minor services like consultation and checkups. Hence, choosing the proper plan for your healthcare needs is important.\r\n\r\nYou may need to consider the following when choosing a self-employed health care plan:\r\n\r\n<strong>A)</strong> Make sure you know exactly what you need coverage for and make sure that is a part of the plan you choose.\r\n\r\n<strong>B)</strong> Recognise the importance of being able to choose your own doctor and/or to stay with the doctor you currently go to right now since a relationship and a high level of trust between you and your doctor have been established. Also ensure that you get quick access to in-hospital treatment such as surgery.\r\n<h2>Apply for Quotes and do comparison shopping</h2>\r\nNow your final step is to sign up for a service that will give you several health insurance quotes, hence enabling you to easily find the best individual health insurance for you. Look through the quotes you receive, study the companies and the plans so you know what you are paying for. Most importantly, look at the find print thoroughly to ascertain what the plan covers or does not cover.\r\n\r\nIf you don\'t have health insurance, you are at risk of losing a lot more if you get into an accident, get injured or are taken in by a sudden illness.\r\n\r\nIn a nut shell, the advantages of private health insurance for the self-employed are early diagnosis of health problems, prompt access to treatment, choice of admission time, date and place and prompt assistance and access to information. This is a crucial factor as treatment is done without conflict with business commitments. Self-employed health insurance policies can also offer a more extensive cover not available on individual health policies.\r\n\r\nIt is fundamental for self-employed people to get health cover specially designed for their status so that they can be treated speedily by doctors of their choice and get back on their feet to resume their business as quickly as possible. Most importantly, they get the type of cover that is more relevant to their needs such as protecting financial loss while being treated for their injury or illness.\";s:10:\"post_title\";s:47:\"Health Insurance for the Self-Employed: A Guide\";s:12:\"post_excerpt\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_status\";s:7:\"publish\";s:14:\"comment_status\";s:6:\"closed\";s:11:\"ping_status\";s:4:\"open\";s:13:\"post_password\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"post_name\";s:46:\"health-insurance-for-the-self-employed-a-guide\";s:7:\"to_ping\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"pinged\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"post_modified\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 08:05:33\";s:17:\"post_modified_gmt\";s:19:\"2017-11-21 08:05:33\";s:21:\"post_content_filtered\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"post_parent\";i:0;s:4:\"guid\";s:46:\"http://healthinsurancecomparison.com.au/?p=146\";s:10:\"menu_order\";i:0;s:9:\"post_type\";s:4:\"post\";s:14:\"post_mime_type\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"comment_count\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"filter\";s:3:\"raw\";}}s:10:\"post_count\";i:10;s:12:\"current_post\";i:-1;s:11:\"in_the_loop\";b:0;s:4:\"post\";r:107;s:8:\"comments\";N;s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:15:\"current_comment\";i:-1;s:7:\"comment\";N;s:11:\"found_posts\";s:3:\"381\";s:13:\"max_num_pages\";d:39;s:21:\"max_num_comment_pages\";i:0;s:9:\"is_single\";b:0;s:10:\"is_preview\";b:0;s:7:\"is_page\";b:0;s:10:\"is_archive\";b:0;s:7:\"is_date\";b:0;s:7:\"is_year\";b:0;s:8:\"is_month\";b:0;s:6:\"is_day\";b:0;s:7:\"is_time\";b:0;s:9:\"is_author\";b:0;s:11:\"is_category\";b:0;s:6:\"is_tag\";b:0;s:6:\"is_tax\";b:0;s:9:\"is_search\";b:0;s:7:\"is_feed\";b:0;s:15:\"is_comment_feed\";b:0;s:12:\"is_trackback\";b:0;s:7:\"is_home\";b:0;s:6:\"is_404\";b:0;s:8:\"is_embed\";b:0;s:8:\"is_paged\";b:0;s:8:\"is_admin\";b:1;s:13:\"is_attachment\";b:0;s:11:\"is_singular\";b:0;s:9:\"is_robots\";b:0;s:13:\"is_posts_page\";b:0;s:20:\"is_post_type_archive\";b:0;s:25:\"\0WP_Query\0query_vars_hash\";s:32:\"d8ec62dcc0e5fd4bb0ff1d64ba1196e2\";s:28:\"\0WP_Query\0query_vars_changed\";b:0;s:17:\"thumbnails_cached\";b:0;s:19:\"\0WP_Query\0stopwords\";N;s:23:\"\0WP_Query\0compat_fields\";a:2:{i:0;s:15:\"query_vars_hash\";i:1;s:18:\"query_vars_changed\";}s:24:\"\0WP_Query\0compat_methods\";a:2:{i:0;s:16:\"init_query_flags\";i:1;s:15:\"parse_tax_query\";}}s:11:\"export_type\";s:8:\"specific\";s:21:\"filter_rules_hierarhy\";s:2:\"[]\";s:21:\"product_matching_mode\";s:6:\"strict\";s:17:\"wp_query_selector\";s:8:\"wp_query\";s:18:\"taxonomy_to_export\";s:0:\"\";s:18:\"created_at_version\";s:5:\"1.2.0\";s:18:\"is_loaded_template\";s:0:\"\";s:18:\"order_item_per_row\";i:1;s:29:\"order_item_fill_empty_columns\";i:1;s:8:\"filepath\";s:89:\"/wpallexport/exports/55fb0f2455cfc4cc68634d7c9ddb9bdd/Posts-Export-2018-March-01-0503.csv\";s:16:\"current_filepath\";s:129:\"/var/www/hic3/wp-content/uploads/wpallexport/exports/55fb0f2455cfc4cc68634d7c9ddb9bdd/current-Posts-Export-2018-March-01-0503.csv\";s:10:\"bundlepath\";s:89:\"/wpallexport/exports/55fb0f2455cfc4cc68634d7c9ddb9bdd/Posts-Export-2018-March-01-0503.zip\";s:8:\"wp_query\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"export_to\";s:3:\"csv\";s:15:\"export_to_sheet\";s:3:\"csv\";s:9:\"delimiter\";s:1:\",\";s:8:\"encoding\";s:5:\"UTF-8\";s:21:\"is_generate_templates\";i:1;s:18:\"is_generate_import\";i:1;s:9:\"import_id\";i:0;s:13:\"template_name\";s:34:\"Posts Export -
